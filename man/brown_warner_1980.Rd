\title{Brown and Warner parametric test (1980).}
\usage{
brown_warner_1980(list_of_returns, event_start, event_end)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_of_returns}{a list of objects of S3 class \code{returns}, each
element of which is treated as a security.}

\item{event_start}{an object of \code{Date} class giving the first date of
the event period.}

\item{event_end}{an object of \code{Date} class giving the last date of the
event period.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the following columns:
\itemize{
    \item \code{date}: a calendar date
    \item \code{weekday}: a day of the week
    \item \code{percentage}: a share of non-missing observations for a given
          day
    \item \code{mean}: an average abnormal return
    \item \code{bw_1980_stat}: a Brown and Warner (1980) test statistic
    \item \code{bw_1980_signif}: a significance of the statistic
}
}
\description{
An event study parametric test described in Brown and Warner 1980.
}
\details{
Performs a parametric test for the event study, which is described in
Brown and Warner 1980. The test assumes a cross-sectional independence
and an insignificance of event-induced variance. The test examines the
hypothesis whether the theoretical cross-sectional expected value for a given
day is equal to zero. The standard deviation in statistics is calculated as
the cross-sectional mean of companies' variances, estimated on the estimation
period. It calculates statistics even if the event window and the estimation
period are overlapped (intersect). The critical values are Student's
t-distributed (no approximation in limit). The significance levels of
\eqn{\alpha} are 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 (marked respectively by *, **, and ***).
It was designed to measure monthly data: for daily data look at Brown and
Warner 1985 and \code{brown_warner_1985}.

## The result of the code above is equivalent to:
data(securities_returns)
brown_warner_1980(list_of_returns = securities_returns,
                  event_start = as.Date("2001-09-11"),
