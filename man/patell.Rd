\title{Patell's parametric test (1976).}
\usage{
patell(list_of_returns, event_start, event_end)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_of_returns}{a list of objects of S3 class \code{returns}, each
element of which is treated as a security.}

\item{event_start}{an object of \code{Date} class giving the first date of
the event period.}

\item{event_end}{an object of \code{Date} class giving the last date of the
event period.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the following columns:
\itemize{
    \item \code{date}: a calendar date
    \item \code{weekday}: a day of the week
    \item \code{percentage}: a share of non-missing observations for a given
          day
    \item \code{mean}: an average abnormal return
    \item \code{pt_stat}: a Patell's test statistic
    \item \code{pt_signif}: a significance of the statistic
}
}
\description{
An event study parametric test described in Patell 1976.
}
\details{
Performs a parametric test for event study, which is described in Patell
1976, which is called standardized-residuals method in Boehmer 1991.
Test's assumptions are a cross-sectional independence and an
insignificance of an event-induced variance. The standardization smooths the
effect of the event-induced variance comparing to Brown and Warner tests.
Also standardization incorporates the situation, when a highly volatile
security dominates the test. The test examines the hypothesis whether the
theoretical cross-sectional expected value for a given day is equal to zero.
It calculates statistics even if event window and estimation period are
overlapped (intersect). The critical values are standard normal. The
significance levels of \eqn{\alpha} are 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 (marked
respectively by *, **, and ***).

## The result of the code above is equivalent to:
data(securities_returns)
patell(list_of_returns = securities_returns,
       event_start =  as.Date("2001-09-11"),
       event_end = as.Date("2001-09-28"))
