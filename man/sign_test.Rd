\title{An event study simple binomial sign test.}
\usage{
sign_test(list_of_returns, event_start, event_end)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_of_returns}{a list of objects of S3 class \code{returns}, each
element of which is treated as a security.}

\item{event_start}{an object of \code{Date} class giving the first date of
the event period.}

\item{event_end}{an object of \code{Date} class giving the last date of the
event period.}
}
\value{
A data frame of the following columns:
\itemize{
    \item \code{date}: a calendar date
    \item \code{weekday}: a day of the week
    \item \code{percentage}: a share of non-missing observations for a given
          day
    \item \code{sign_stat}: a sign test statistic
    \item \code{sign_signif}: a significance of the statistic
}
}
\description{
A binomial sign test which determines whether the frequency of positive
abnormal returns in the event period is significantly different from
one-half.
}
\details{
This test is application of the simple binomial test to the event study,
which indicates whether the cross-sectional frequency of positive abnormal
returns is significantly different from 0.5. This test is stable
to outliers, in other words allows for checking if the result is driven by
few companies with extremely large abnormal performance. For this test the
estimation period and the event period must not overlap, otherwise an error
will be thrown. The test statistic is assumed to have a normal distribution
in approximation under a null hypothesis, if the number of securities is
large. Typically the test is used together with parametric tests.
The test is well-specified for the case, when cross-sectional abnormal
returns are not symmetric. Also this procedure is less sensitive to extreme
returns than the rank test. The significance levels of \eqn{\alpha} are 0.1,
0.05, and 0.01 (marked respectively by *, **, and ***).

## The result of the code above is equivalent to:
data(securities_returns)
sign_test(list_of_returns = securities_returns,
          event_start =  as.Date("2001-09-11"),
          event_end = as.Date("2001-09-28"))
