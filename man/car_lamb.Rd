\title{Lamb's CAR test (1995).}
\usage{
car_lamb(list_of_returns, car_start, car_end, percentage = 90)
}
\arguments{
\item{list_of_returns}{list of objects of S3 class \code{return}, each element
of which is treated as a company.}

\item{car_start}{the object of class \code{Date}, which represents the
first (starting) date of the time period, over which CAR will be estimated.}

\item{car_end}{the object of class \code{Date}, which represents the last
(ending) date of the time period, over which CAR will be estimated.}

\item{percentage}{the lowest allowed percentage of non-missing observation
for each day to be incorporated into CAR. Defaule value is 90 percent.}
}
\value{
The list of starting date, ending date, average percentage of
non-missing observation over each day, the value of statistics, the length
of the time period, and significance.
}
\description{
Parametric test, proposed by Lamb (1995), which examines whether or not
cumulative abnormal return (CAR) significantly differs from zero.
}
\details{
This function performs the test, proposed by Lamb (1995) to investigate
whether CAR significantly differs from zero. This tests uses the variance,
specified by Lamb (1995). The advantage of this test is allowance for
correlated cross-sectional returns. Test statistic is close enough to statistic,
produced by \code{\link{car_brown_warner_1985}}. The critical
values are standard normal. The significance levels of \eqn{\alpha} are 0.1,
0.05, and 0.01 (marked respectively by *, **, and ***).
