Description: An implementation of a most commonly used event study methodology,
    including both parametric and nonparametric tests. It contains variety
    aspects of the rate of return estimation (the core calculation is done in
    C++), as well as three classical market models: mean adjusted retruns,
    market adjusted returns and single-index market models. There are 6
    parametric and 6 nonparametric tests provided, which examin
    cross-sectional daily abnormal return (see the documentation of the
    functions for more information). Furthemore, tests for the cumulative
    abnormal returns are included.
